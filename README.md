Description:
This project was made in Python using the Django Web App framework. The site queries the Open Brewery DB API to fetch a list of all breweries in the city of San Antonio. The endpoint can be adjusted to fetch by city or state. The navbar also contains a search input form in order to search by brewery name. If a match is found, the details of the matched brewery is displayed individually on the app.

Instructions:
In order to clone and use the source files as is, Python and Django must be installed on the system. A local server must be initiated in a virtual environment:

1. Download the Django-Brewery project root folder on your local machine.

2. In your terminal, navigate to the root project folder

3. Run the command 'pip install virtualenv' to install the virtual environment files.

4. Run the command 'pip install Django' to install the web app framework.

5. Run the command to launch the virtual environment. For Windows (Powershell): '.\Scripts\activate'

6. Run the command to launch the local server. For Windows (Powershell): '.\manage.py runserver'

7. If successful, the python console will deploy a local server with a local URL to run the web app. This should be something like 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/'

8. Navigate to the URL and the web app should be functional locally.
