  Description:<br/>
  This project was made in Python using the Django Web App framework. The site queries the Open Brewery DB API to fetch a list of all breweries in the city of San Antonio. The endpoint can be adjusted to fetch by city or state. The navbar also contains a search input form in order to search by brewery name. If a match is found, the details of the matched brewery is displayed individually on the app.
  <br/><br/>
  Instructions:<br/>
  In order to clone and use the source files as is, Python and Django must be installed on the system. A local server must be initiated in a virtual environment:<br/><br/>

  2. In your terminal, navigate to the root project folder.<br/><br/>

  3. Run the command 'pip install virtualenv' to install the virtual environment files.<br/><br/>

  4. Run the command 'pip install Django' to install the web app framework.<br/><br/>

  5. Run the command to launch the virtual environment. For Windows (Powershell): '.\Scripts\activate'.<br/><br/>

  6. Run the command to launch the local server. For Windows (Powershell): '.\manage.py runserver'.<br/><br/>

  7. If successful, the python console will deploy a local server with a local URL to run the web app. This should be something like 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/'.<br/><br/>
